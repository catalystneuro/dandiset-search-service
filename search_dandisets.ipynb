    "# Identify Dandisets relevant to a scientific question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to provide a system that, based on the user's questions, suggests dandisets that could be of relevance. The hope is that ChatGPT will be able to use semantic information of the question and return better results than simple text matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan of action\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Collect metadata from dandisets.\n",
    "<img src=\"step1_embed_dandiset_metadata.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px;\" />\n",
    "For each Dandiset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- get name, description, \n",
    "- get assets summary: approaches, measurement techniques, variables measured\n",
    "- for species, we can get accurate info from NCBITaxon, if it's included\n",
    "- (?) get related resources: scrape title/summary from articles\n",
    "- Use OpenAI ada-002 to vectorize each information piece\n",
    "- Store the vectors in Qdrant, have the original dandiset id as object metadata for each vector\n",
    "- (?) any useful extra info we could include on object metadata, for later filtered searches?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Process user questions\n",
    "<img src=\"step2_do_search.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "- User queries can come in the form of questions, e.g.: \"Which datasets can I use to investigate the effects of drug YYYY on cells of type XXXX?\"\n",
    "- For method 1, the question is passed directly to a semantic embedding API using OpenAI.\n",
    "- For method 2, a prompt instructs the LLM to extract useful neuroscience research-related keywords from the question, and proceed to use the semantic search engine. We can achieve this using [OpenAI functions](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates)\n",
    "- (simple approach) We return the dandiset IDs present in the top results \n",
    "- (advanced approach) We gather the text content of the collected metadata for the dandisets in the top results and include them in a prompt together with the user's original question and a default instruction such as: \"Given the user question and the listed reference datasets, which datasets could help address the user's question, and why?\""

Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0 (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant, which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems. This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'}\n",

Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete  collapse of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished  thalamic activity.

The craniotomy was filled with 10-15 μL of 1.5% agarose, and a D-shaped coverslip was secured on top to suppress brain motion and leave access to the brain on the lateral side of the craniotomy. Then mice were lightly anesthetized and mounted under a custom two-photon microscope. Full-field, high-contrast drifting gratings were presented in each of eight directions to the contralateral eye. Two-photon imaging (122 Hz) was performed of L2/3 somata and neuropil combined with loose-seal, cell-attached electrophysiological recording of a single neuron in the field of view.\n",

      "description: Understanding how excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) inputs are integrated by neurons requires monitoring their subthreshold behavior. We probed the subthreshold dynamics using optogenetic depolarizing pulses in hippocampal neuronal assemblies in freely moving mice. Excitability decreased during sharp- wave ripples coupled with increased I. In contrast to this “negative gain,” optogenetic probing showed increased within-field excitability in place cells by weakening I and unmasked stable place fields in initially non–place cells. Neuronal assemblies active during sharp-wave ripples in the home cage predicted spatial overlap and sequences of place fields of both place cells and unmasked preexisting place fields of non–place cells during track running. Thus, indirect probing of subthreshold dynamics in neuronal populations permits the disclosing of preexisting assemblies and modes of neuronal operations.\n",

      "description: When a behavior repeatedly fails to achieve its goal, animals often give up and become passive, which can be strategic for preserving energy or regrouping between attempts. It is unknown how the brain identifies behavioral failures and mediates this behavioral-state switch. In larval zebrafish swimming in virtual reality, visual feedback can be withheld so that swim attempts fail to trigger expected visual flow. After tens of seconds of such motor futility, animals became passive for similar durations. Whole-brain calcium imaging revealed noradrenergic neurons that responded specifically to failed swim attempts and radial astrocytes whose calcium levels accumulated with increasing numbers of failed attempts. Using cell ablation and optogenetic or chemogenetic activation, we found that noradrenergic neurons progressively activated brainstem radial astrocytes, which then suppressed swimming. Thus, radial astrocytes perform a computation critical for behavior: they accumulate evidence that current actions are ineffective and consequently drive changes in behavioral states.\n",

The craniotomy was filled with 10-15 μL of 1.5% agarose, and a D-shaped coverslip was secured on top to suppress brain motion and leave access to the brain on the lateral side of the craniotomy. Then mice were lightly anesthetized and mounted under a custom two-photon microscope. Full-field, high-contrast drifting gratings were presented in each of eight directions to the contralateral eye.
